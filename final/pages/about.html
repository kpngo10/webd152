            <h2>About The Resort</h2>
            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>The history of <span class="resort">Pacific Trails Resort</span> traces back to our founder Hughes Clark who took a research expedition along the California northern coast in the 1980s. The vision then began with a simple idea: to share with people from around the world the majestic beauty of the Pacific Trails while offering them a luxurious experience. In the early days, the resort was called Pacific Trails Retreat.</p>

                <p>Since the early days of our development, we have been continuously growing to meet the needs of our dear guests. In 2007, we re-branded and became the Pacific Trails Resort. Now, in addition to 60 guest cottages, we also offer luxurious retreat yurt packages. The Pacific Trails National Park is a sight to behold. We invite you to immerse yourself in its rich natural beauty, and let us take care of the rest!</p>
